### Purpose

This lab will create the environment for the CI/CD process. Service Principals are leveraged to allow permission to deploy or update resources in a certain environment for a specific purpose. The Service Connections are based off the Service Principals permissions that is limited to what is required for updates and deployments of the resources. It gives Administrators better control over their environment while allowing the engineers to have concern with only their code.
