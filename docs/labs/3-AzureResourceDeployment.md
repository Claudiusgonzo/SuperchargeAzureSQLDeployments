### Purpose
This lab is to build your foundational knowledge of how to leverage Azure DevOps to deploy Azure Resource with CI/CD pipelines.  This lab walks you through advanced ARM templates showing you how you can have an end state configuration for your Azure resource to limit the need to do post deployment configuration. You will create both a build and release pipeline which covers the CI/CD portions of DevOps.

 **Summary**

## <div style="color: #107c10">Exercise - Advanced ARM template</div>

### Lunch VS Code

1. Open **sql_db.json** file
   1. Located in: **Deployments** > **ARM** > **templates**</br>

![](./imgs/sql_db.png)

1. Review lines **180 - 196** there are multiple example of how you can use functions in ARM templates to control behavior and maybe your deployments dynamic.
2. Review lines **376** - **410**, these resources are examples of how you can create multiple Firewall Range rules and/or vNet Firewall rules using copy index and a parameter array
3. Review lines **411** & **486** this is an example of how to use copy index to deploy multiple databases with the option of different SKUs for each DB  

   1. Also note that this resource uses a nested resource to perform some other configurations on each database like: ensure TDE is enabled, auditing is configured, and Security Alert Policies are set
   
4. This ARM template can be used to be deploy: Storage account, Log Analytics, SQL Logical Server, and multiple SQL DB(s). </br>

:bulb: You may see older schema versions this is because the template is designed to work in both Azure Commercial and Azure Government

6. Close **sql_db.json** without saving anything

#### Edit parameter file

1. Open **sql_db.parameter.dev.json** file
    1. Located in: **Deploymnets** > **ARM** > **parameter** </br>

![](./imgs/parameters.png)

1. Before making any changes to the parameter file spend some time reviewing it and reading through all of the comments.
   1. Each parameter has comments to help provide you with context of the value needed
   2. For this workshop you will only need to updated the values we call out, but are free to test other values outside of the workshop.

2. Enter name for **serverName**, line **27**
   1. The server name needs to be globally unique
   2. Recommend using: **\<alias>-sqlsrv-dev** (ie jdoe-sqlsrv-dev) </br>

![](./imgs/srvName.png)

4. Enter **serverADAdminGroup** at line **29** and **serverADAdminSID** at line **39**
   1. You can look up these values in Azure AD </br>

![](./imgs/serverAdmin.png) </br>

![](./imgs/parmAdmin.png)</br>

1. Enter **emailAddress ** at line **162**

:exclamation: Email address for where you want Security Alerts and Vulnerability Assessment scans sent.

![](./imgs/email.png)

1. Save and close **sql_db.parameter.dev.json** file

#### Test deployment with PowerShell

1. Click **File** > **New File** or keyboard shortcut: *Ctrl + N*
2. Set File format to PowerShell

![](./imgs/PS1filetype2.png)

![](./imgs/PS1filetype.png)

![](./imgs/PS1filetype3.png)

3. Run the following to test your ARM deployment with PowerShell

```PowerShell
Login-AzAccount
#For Azure Government use:  
#Login-AzAccount -Environment AzureUSGovernment

#Select the correct Subscription
Select-AzSubscription â€“Subscription '<Id>'

$params = @{
    ResourceGroupName = '<enter your RG name>' #Dev Resource Group from lab 2
    TemplateFile = '.\DLM\AzureSQLDB\Deployments\ARM\templates\sql_db.json'
    TemplateParameterFile = '.\DLM\AzureSQLDB\Deployments\ARM\parameters\sql_db.parameters.dev.json'
    Verbose = $true
}
#Test ARM deployment
Test-AzResourceGroupDeployment @params 
```
Expended Result
> VERBOSE: time ran - Template is valid.

4. Run the following to deploy your ARM template with PowerShell
   
```PowerShell
$params = @{
    ResourceGroupName = '<enter your RG name>' #Dev Resource Group from lab 2
    TemplateFile = '.\DLM\AzureSQLDB\Deployments\ARM\templates\sql_db.json'
    TemplateParameterFile = '.\DLM\AzureSQLDB\Deployments\ARM\parameters\sql_db.parameters.dev.json'
    Verbose = $true
}

#Deploy ARM template
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment @params

#To Check Resources Deployed Run:
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName "dlm-demo-dev" | Format-Table

```

5. You can check the status of your deployment from the protal
   1. Log into: [portal.azure.com](https:/portal.azure.com)
   2. Navagate to the Resource Group you deployed to
   3. Click on **Deployments** blade
   4. Click on **Related events** to view details about the deployment

![](./imgs/rgDeployment2.png)

6. Once deployment completes check that all resource deployed

![](./imgs/rgResources.png)

1. Close **Untitled-1** PowerShell file, no need to save
2. **Stage** & **Commit** any changes to your repo
3. **Sync** or **Push** your changes to your remote branch (Azure DevOps Repo)

## <div style="color: #107c10">Exercise - Build Pipeline (CI)</div>

In this exercise you will walk through all of the steps needed to create the Continuous integration (CI) portion of your Azure Resource deployment. This step is called the build process.  You will test that your ARM template build correctly.

11. Select **Save**
12. Click **Save** on the comment window (entering a comment here is optional)

:bulb: You now have built and setup a working Continuos integrations pipeline for your Azure Resources in your dev branch.  This will be a CI pipeline used when developing and updating your ARM templates.  

### Testing Azure Resource CI pipeline

1. Click on Pipelines
2. Hover over your pipeline to expose and click on the ellipses
3. Click on **Run pipeline** (you are manually testing your build)

5. Click **Run**

![](./imgs/ci-run-pipeline2.png)

6. Click on Publish Deployment Artifacts under Jobs

![](./imgs/ci-run-pipeline3.png)

7. This is where you can view the status of your build and the logs generated durning run time. 
8. Once job finishes running you should see green check marks at each phase
9. Click on **View raw log** to view the full log of the build. Note this can be helpful when troubleshooting issues with failed builds.

![](./imgs/ci-view-logs.png)

10. You now have published artifacts that can be used in your dev continuous deployment (CD) (dev Release pipeline)

## <div style="color: #107c10">Exercise - Release Pipeline (CI)</div>
In this exercise you will walk through all of the steps needed to create the Continuous Deployment (CD) portion of your Azure Resource deployment.  This step is called the **Release**.  The release will be triggered from a successful build pipeline.
